# Ayu

Colours are applied based on Obsidian semantics and appearance on code editors. Headings and indicators have warmer colours, while body emphasis are cooler.

This theme uses **Ayu Light** and **Ayu Mirage**. But you also have **Ayu Dark** in `theme.css` in case you want to apply it yourself.

This adaptation is based on [Ayu Colors](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-colors). The original theme is by [Ike](https://dempfi.com/).

# Fonts

Lora Italic sets the mood as inline title, heading 2 and heading 5.
